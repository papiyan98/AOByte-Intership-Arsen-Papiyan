#REACT JS Homework

1. Create a list with posts (Lets call it a "pool")
2. Each post must have multiple comments
3. Each comment must have a rate
4. Create a container with two columns (List 1 and List 2)
5. Each column must have 2 buttons
  a. "+" adds the post with highest average rating from the pool to a column
   the posts must be shown in the column without comments, but each one should show the average rate of its comments
   also each post must have a "-" button, which removes the post from the column and enables it in the "pool"
   the posts must be sorted by average rate
   the same post cannot go into both columns
  b. "sort" toggles the sorting direction of the posts (from ascending to descending and vice versa)

When adding a post from a "pool" to a column, the post should not be removed from the "pool", but
should be visually disabled
